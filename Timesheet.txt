AMLIU (D)
15-112 Term project time sheet
TOTAL TIME SPENT: ~50-60 hours

NOTE: Unfortunately, I have only recently started to keep track of my progress as I was not aware of the requirement of a timesheet when I was getting my headstart on the project. Therefore, information before 4/12/2013 may be inaccurate time-wise and may miss a few features coded, though I will try my best to recount.
